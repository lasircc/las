						<b>Laboratory Assistant Suite</b> (<b>LAS</b>) platform assists the researchers in different laboratory activities. Its modular architecture allows managing different kinds of raw data (e.g., biological, molecular) and tracking experimental data. Each LAS module is tailored to handle specific activities or data types, but it is plugged into a broader and uniform framework thus allowing effortless integration with other systemâ€™s elements. In addition, the data models and procedures integrated in the platform try to comply with best practices and standards widely adopted by the research community at large. User interfaces are designed to be practical in hostile environments, in which researchers should minimize their interactions with the system during data entry procedures (e.g., in sterile conditions). Furthermore, the platform supports the integration of different resources and aids in performing a variety of analyses in order to extract knowledge related to tumors. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The LAS platform is the result of a joint effort by both IT and biomedical researchers of the <a href="https://ircc.it/">Candiolo Cancer Institute</a>.

						Every day in research laboratories several procedures are performed to analyze different
						biological and medical aspects of tumors, with the aim of discovering new knowledge and
						improving the therapies. We started to analyze a subset of procedures developed and adopted in
						the research laboratories of our institution to model our environment. At the beginning, we
						focused our attention on the procedures that are involved in the xenopatient experimental
						pipeline (Bertotti et al., 2011). This approach is based on the serial transplantation of human
						tumor specimens in immunocompromised animals. The aim is to help in translating the
						correlative information emerging from data integration into clinically relevant and functionally
						validated biomarkers. After completing the main modules addressing the management of tumor
						specimen and xenopatient life cycle, we started to include additional elements to our environment
						in order to manage several research activities and exploit collected data.

					<p>
						To the aim of managing and integrating all this information, a robust but flexible data
						management platform is needed. In particular, different types of information (e.g., biological
						data, molecular data, procedure tracking data, sample tracking data), some of which can be
						highly complex, should be independently managed by the platform but, at the same time,
						interconnected to permit integrated analyses. User interfaces should be practical and intuitive on
						one side, and perfectly fit the actual procedures on the other, in order to avoid hindering the
						experimental pipeline. This is particularly relevant when working with biological samples, which
						implies that many data should be entered by the user in a hostile environment (e.g., working with
						gloves in sterile conditions with potentially infectious samples). To the best of our knowledge,
						the procedures adopted in our experimental pipeline are largely standardized, and they reflect
						common practice in the oncological research field. Thus, we believe that most functionalities
						offered by the system we are developing could be useful to other research institutes. The LAS
						software platform is freely available upon request to the authors.
